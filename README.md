#Steroids Repro Template

Steroids Repro Template is a stripped-down Steroids project for reproducing Steroids issues. Clone it to your computer, create your repro case and put it on Github. Let us know about it by creating a new issue on [the Scanner issue tracker](https://github.com/AppGyver/scanner/issues) and linking your repro case to the issue or linking it to an existing issue.

For more information, see the [Creating excellent reproductions for issues](http://guides.appgyver.com/steroids/guides/debugging/creating-excellent-reproductions/) guide.
